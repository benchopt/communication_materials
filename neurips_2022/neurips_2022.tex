\begin{frame}{Benchmarking algorithms is a pain}

Numerical validation is at the heart of Machine Learning.

% Best methods are chosen
\vskip2em

Doing a benchmark is a hassle:


% \begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Takes time to reimplement methods
	\item Takes time for reviewers to check reimplementations
	\item Takes time to recode the tools needed
	\item All of this $\times$ yearly number of ML submissions
\end{itemize}
% \end{minipage}

\vskip2em


With \Benchopt{} we this effort \textbf{open}, \textbf{collaborative} and \textbf{easy}.

\begin{frame}{\texttt{benchopt}}

    Metrics to follow, multiple parameters for a solver, easy way to filter out solvers

    HTML results are easy to share between collaborators, can be uploaded

    Parallel runs, results caching, csv

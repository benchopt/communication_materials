\begin{frame}{Benchmarking algorithms is a pain}

Machine Learning research relies on numerical validation.

\vskip2em

Pain points of a benchmark:\\[.2em]
\begin{itemize}
	\item competitors' Methods do not work out of the box.
	\item re-code methods and tools to integrate a new method.
	\item hard to extend with new settings.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What is \Benchopt{}?}

\Benchopt{} is a framework to organize and run benchmarks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item one repository per benchmark
    \item one base open source \texttt{Python} CLI to run them.
\end{itemize}

\vskip1em
Examples of existing benchmarks:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resnet18
        \item Lasso

        \item Logistic regression
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{\Benchopt{} makes your life easy}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item build on previous benchmarks
        \item use solvers in Python, R, Julia, binaries...
        \item monitor any metric you want altogether (test/train loss, ...)
        \item add parameters to solvers
        \item share and publish HTML results
        \item run all benchmarks in parallel
        \item cache results
        \item and much more!
